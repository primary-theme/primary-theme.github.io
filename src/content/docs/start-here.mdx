### Install Beta Version

This option is exclusive to monthly subscribers of Primary.

<Steps>
1. Head on over to [Primary's Ko-fi](https://dub.sh/primary/ko-fi) page.Under Buy a Coffee, choose Membership and subscribe to get access to member exclusive posts.
2. After subscribing, head over to the `Posts` tab. This is under the header, just below my name and ko-fi link.
3. Once in the Posts tab, you should be able to find posts usually titled along the lines of `Primary x.x.x-beta (Monthly Subscriber Exclusive)`. Click on the latest post.
4. The post includes the full Release Notes so you're fully informed what new features or fixes you get for that release! To get the a copy of that beta, scroll down a bit until you find the `Click here to download the CSS file.` link. This should take you to a GitHub gist page.
5. On the GitHub gist page at the top right side, click **Download Zip**. This will give you a `.zip` file with 1 file inside, the `primary-x.x.x-beta.css` file (where x.x.x is the version number).
6. Unzip the file and copy the CSS file.
7. Paste it under your vault's `.obsidian/themes` folder. You can open this folder through Obsidian. To do so, open up *Settings*, and go to the *Appearance* tab. Under `Themes`, there's an icon beside the theme dropdown. Click it to open the themes folder. It should open up the folder `Vault Name/.obsidian/themes`. Paste the CSS file there.
8. Go back to Obsidian and open up your Command Palette. Type `Reload app without saving` and press enter so that your Obsidian gets reloaded and ensures it identifies the CSS file.
9. Once your Obsidian has reloaded, open up Settings -> Appearance tab. Under the `Themes` dropdown, select the `primary-x.x.x-beta` you downloaded. This should load the theme.
10. Reload the app again for best results.
